## Introduction
This repository contains a sample program demonstrating the use of `OPENCV`, a [brief description of what the package/library does]. This program aims to showcase a few basic functionalities of `OPENCV` and serve a practical purpose [describe the practical purpose briefly].

## Getting Started

### Size dependant
The following program is size dependant. Meaning that depending on the waldo test and your computer screen or monitor matters. The terminal will promt for which test to do, but if anyone would like to mess around with the values or there own photos these values worked the best.

#### test 1 (Use Waldo folder one)
    f1 = 0.7
    f2 = 0.7

#### test 2 (If using a monitor or any computer with an aspect ratio of 21:9 for hard waldo test)
    f1 = 0.3
    f2 = 0.7

#### test 3 (If using latop for hard waldo test)
    f1 = 0.5
    f2 = 1.2
